# To do list

**Programming**
- Creating a blank pygame window
- Displaying a sample character
- Being able to move the character
- Making the power arrow and getting the initial velocity from it
- Make the character move according to the physics equation
- Display an image of the ground
- Make the collisions with the ground
- Display an image of the goal (a flag for instance)
- Make the player win when the character touches the flag
- Being able to load a level from a file (this way, the programmers can focus on coding the game physics whilst the level design can be done by someone else)

**Graphics/Design**
- Image of the character
- Find some ideas for the theme of the levels
- Find some ideas for the user interface
- Image of the arrow
- Image for the background

**Everyone**
- Make sure you can push and pull work from the Github repository. When testing that it works, please don't push to the master branch, create a new test branch and push there. The master branch will be used for work that is clean and has been reviewed. Everyone should create a branch with their name, and push their work there. At the end of the week, we check the work together and merge clean work to the master branch.
